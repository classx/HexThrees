# HexTrees

HexThrees is a small puzzle game that can help pass the time or gets you hands distracted while listening to music or podcast. The original idea was to build [Threes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threes/id779157948) and [2048](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2048/id840919914) clone in hexagonal space, but, as I believe, HexThrees became something clearly different from original.

Under the hood it is using SpriteKit and UIKit, therefore it is iOS only game. There is no third-party frameworks, all code is written by myself. If some parts were copied from stackoverflow, it is mentioned in comments.  

This is free time hobby project that was build mostly during  [train commute](https://www.hvv.de/en) and code quality is far from perfect, although I have tried to keep logic (commands) separately from view (Scenes, VC's and Nodes).
